# 4x5-Macropad

A 3D-printed, hand-soldered 4x5 macropad powered by an Arduino Pro Micro, running QMK and compatible with VIA. I created this as a school project, and after a few friends showed interest in making their own, I decided to share my project along with a tutorial here.

## What You'll Need
### Electronics:
- Arduino Pro Micro
- 20 × 1N4148 Diodes
- 20 × Keyswitches
- 4x4mm Button 
- Jumper Wires
### Tools:
- Soldering iron
- Hot glue gun
### Other Materials:
- Access to a 3D printer for the case and keyswitch bracket

## Installation and Setup
### Firmware
- First, you want to download the latest version of QMK MSYS from [QMK MSYS](https://msys.qmk.fm/) and QMK Toolbox from [QMK Toolbox](https://qmk.fm/toolbox), as well as [VIA](https://github.com/cebby2420/via-desktop/releases/tag/v2025.1.13) if you wish to keep a local instal copy. Otherwise, you can also reprogram keys from its [browser version](https://usevia.app/).

### Assembly 
- After 3D printing the parts, we can start making your macropad. Place all your keys inside the bracket, making sure all the pins face one direction.
